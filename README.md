# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

I was inspired to develop a weather application capable of accommodating various location inputs. This project was designed to assist individuals seeking weather forecasts tailored to specific locations, addressing the inconvenience of having to refresh a page whenever someone desired weather information for a different location. Through this endeavor, I gained valuable experience in utilizing APIs to present precise data within an application.
